# 🎵 Arduino/ESP32 Buzzer – Senbonzakura

> **Play Japanese music with a buzzer on Arduino/ESP32**  
> This project plays the song **千本桜 (Senbonzakura)** through a passive buzzer, compatible with both Arduino and ESP32 boards.  
> You can try it directly on Wokwi without any physical hardware!

## 📄 Main Code

The `main.ino` file contains:

- **melody[]** array: note frequencies for Senbonzakura (defined in `pitches.h`)
- **noteDurations[]** array: note lengths (beats)
- `tone()` function to play notes
- Delay between notes to create pauses

## ❤️ Why I made this

Because I heard this and felt it funny [Senbonzakura](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqps4anhz0Q) so I wanted to turn it into a **buzzer version** to both practice and share the joy with others.
